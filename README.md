# Classifying digits, CNN-style
~~"Fake neural network!" -- someone~~
No, not that CNN

A basic image classification task I did to get more familiar with Convolutional Neural Networks. Two neural networks are constructed: a normal sequential/dense one, and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The normal neural network achieved around 94% accuracy while the CNN had around 98% accuracy, demonstrating its superiority in image processing tasks.
